Categories: `Misc`, `Steg`

## Description
A friend asked me to give them some criticism... I decided hide my feedback as a [photo](https://github.com/absurdtiger/tigerCTF/raw/main/Tiger01/tiger1.jpg)... surely no one will find the message if it's not in plaintext?
I hope they don't lose their **head** finding the **magic**. 

This challenge has 2 flags. 

## Remarks

### Solution
